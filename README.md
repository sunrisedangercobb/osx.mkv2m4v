# osx_apps-mkv2m4v
A basic wrapper for subler, to quickly convert compatible .mkv files to .m4v.

Another shout out to one of my favorite tools when working with video, I cannot express how much time the dev of subler has saved me; thanks for the hard work!!

This is a simple wrapper for the SublerCLI tool that allows you to quickly extract compatible video/audio/subs from the .mkv container and move them to .m4v (.mp4).  This runs in single or batch mode and allows for target/destination settings.  Files will not be removed by default but you will rather be prompted at the end of the job.

# note
I would highly recommend playing the file before removal of the old.  Not all .mkv are compatibility canidates!
